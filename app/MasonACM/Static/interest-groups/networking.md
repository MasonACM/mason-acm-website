## Welcome to the Networking and LAN Party Special Interest Group!
This page contains information about the LAN Party, which usually occurs twice a year, once on the last day before winter break, and once sometime after AP testing.  

Since ~100 usually attend the party it requires advanced network and power management.  If that interests you, meet in the small commons right after school the day of the LAN Party and help set up!
