# We are a First Tech Challenge Robotics (FTC) team
We are going to compete at regionals and possibly at naitonals!

## Chairman
Manny Setegn

## General Information
We are a robotics team that meets Tuesdays and Thursdays at Mr. Kummer's room B109. If you are interested in engineering or programming then this is a good special interest group for you. 

## Membership
Just come to the meetings on Tuesdays and Thursday after school and we will add you to the team. We also may meet on the weekends and at a machining lab at U.C once a month.

## Game
The robotics game this year is Block Party. If you are new, go on the FTC [website](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc) and check out the video and rules packet to understand the game.

## Programming
We will be using RobotC for programming the robot. Check out RobotC virtual world for a good simulation. This will help with practicing and programming for the robot.

## Designing & Building
We will be using the FTC kit for building the robot. We also may do welding or pneumatics with the robot as well. All of our designs and diagrams will be kept in the engineering notebook.
