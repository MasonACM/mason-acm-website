
## Welcome to Mason ACM's Web Development Special Interest Group!

We primarily focus on developing and extending the Mason ACM website (hint: this is the Mason ACM website). It's written in PHP, specifically the [Laravel](http://laravel.com) framework, and uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), MySQL, and Git.  The souce code is located [here](https://github.com/bhoeting/mason-acm-website).

## Chairmen
- Brennan Hoeting
- Tyler Hilbert
- Neil Giridharan
- Nathan Kuenzig

## General Information
We will be working a lot with the mobile special interest group to integrate features that work across both platforms. We plan to have multiple website redesigns to make the website as responsive and user friendly as possible. We will be using frameworks such as Laravel to make the website. The website will also be responsive on the mobile web, so users not on supported platforms can still view the website on their mobile browsers.

## Membership
Come talk to one of of the chairmen if you are interested in contributing to the 
website. We will primarily need content writers and bug testers to find bugs on
the website. If you have any features that you want to add to the website, come
talk to us and we can try to implement it.

## Master Classes
Every now and then, INTERalliance will host a PHP Master class. This is a great way to get your feet wet with web development. If you are interested in making websites or contributing to the Mason ACM website then it is highly recommended that you go. INTERalliance may also have other master classes in Django or Rails.

## Road map
- ~~Website redesign~~
- A programming tutorial system, which will include step by step instructions and syntax highlighting
- LAN Party gaming tournament formation
